This project is a web-based platform that connects house owners or real estate agents with tenants looking for rooms or houses to rent.
House owners or agents can post rental listings with all necessary details about the property, while tenants can browse available listings, save properties they are interested in, 
and contact the house owner or agent directly through the platform.
The goal of this project is to simplify the rental process by providing a centralized platform where property owners can advertise their rentals and tenants can easily find suitable accommodation.
